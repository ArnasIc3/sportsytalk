    A team sport is a type of athletic activity where the fundamental nature of the game or sport necessitates the participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, and it is inherently impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavor. In team sports, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function and achieve its objectives.The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football, and hockey. These sports emphasize teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members, while competing against opposing teams, to achieve a common goal.[2] Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport.[3]
